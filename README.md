# Water_quality-monitoring_and_controlling_system
It is a bachelor final year project


In this thesis we proposed a water quality monitoring and control system based on internet of things (IoT) technology, which monitors the quality and quantity of water and cleans the dirty water. The system automatically collects water data using various water sensors and transfers it to remote servers via the Internet. Depending on the volume of water it automatically opens the water pump and if the water purity value falls below a certain level it notifies the owner and cleans the water tank and disposes of the wasted water.

Android devices can automatically download and display data from the server via the Internet. The main function of this system is to verify whether the water is dirty through real time analysis of water data and to clean the water tank by removing the dirty water from the water tank. We collected water data from many samples, we processed those data and we plotted data to visualize the correlation among those water parameters. Also the performance of this project is evaluated and we found 93\% accuracy.
